# Evosuite for j2HTML with JUnit

In this project, Evosuite was used to generate automated JUnit test cases for J2HTML package.

In this Evosuite generation, test methods were added part by part to generate test cases and they were copied and pasted back to the original project, as Evosuite sometimes unable to generate
large amount of test cases at a time.

### path to JUnit test methods
main\java\com\example\J2HTMLConversion.java

### path to JUnit test cases generated by Evosuite
test\java\com\example\J2HTMLConversion_ESTest.java


## Getting started
### 1. Add test methods

1. Test methods can be added to the class avaliable in "J2HTMLConversion.java" file in the main method.

### 2. To run Evosuite

1. Convert the project code to byte code using following command.

    ```
    cd demo

    mvn compile
    ```

2. Generate test cases using evosuite

    ```
    mvn evosuite:generate
    ```

3. To outsource generated test cases to J2HTMLConversion_ESTest.java file.

    ```
    mvn evosuite:export
    ```

Everytime the test cases were generated, they were copied and pasted back to the original project, where JUnit test cases are run. - "AllureReportJ2HtML" project
